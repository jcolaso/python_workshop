inside the cemetery fence. One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts
and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.

cemetery."" He jumped back on his bike and rode off.

here quick,"" said the boy. ""You won't believe what I heard! Satan and the
Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls.""

can see the Lord himself.""

see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the

I was a very happy person. My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me ... it was her beautiful younger sister. 
My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, without underwear or a bra. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a pleasant view. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. 
One day ""little"" sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me."" 
I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled off her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.

"Simon and his favorite uncle were driving along a dark road one night when the car swerves off the road. Simon regains consciousness in the hospital to be told that his legs were so badly severed that they had to be removed. Simon is obviously in a critical state of mind at this news and is completely distraught to hear that his uncle didnt survive the accident. The only consolation to Simon was that the doctors were confident of being able to perform surgery, which would allow him to get use of his uncles legs, and soon be walking again.
Some time later, Simon received notice from ""stars in their eyes"", hosted by none other than Mathew Kelly, to say that he was successful in his audition earlier and he was to perform in a few days.
The big day came and Mathew introduced Simon to the crowd. Shocked to see Simon now in a wheelchair, Mathew asked about the accident. After telling of his tragic ordeal, Simon beamed with pride as the crowd applauded his courage to perform, waiting in anticipation to hear who he will be. ""So tell us who you are going to be tonight Simon..."" asked Matthew. Simon replied..."" well tonight Mathew.... Im going to be Simon and Half uncle""","Ranking:

A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in nine holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him. 

To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green. 

After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree."" 

With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay.

Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a ""power wash and rinse"" which I have found to be quite effective. 
Have someone open the back door and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the garden.

Al Gore's Answer:  I invented the chicken. I invented the road. Therefore, the chicken crossing the road represented the application of these two different functions of government in a new, reinvented way designed to bring greater services to the

Barbara Walters' Answer: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart-warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting and went on to accomplish its life-long dream of crossing the road. 

Ralph Nader's Answer: The chicken's habitat on the original side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrialist greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of  a gas-guzzling SUV. 

Jerry Seinfield's Answer:  Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why anyone doesn't ever think to ask, ""What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place anyway?"" 

Pat Buchanan's Answer:  To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American. 

Rush Limbaugh's Answer:  I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet someone out there is already 
forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can 
you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars, and when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took from you to build roads for chickens to cross. 

Jerry Falwell's Answer:  Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't you people see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the ""other side."" That's what they call it -- the other side. Yes, my friends, that chicken is 
gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott

We always hear the rules"" from the female side.
Now here are the rules from the male side.
These are our rules!
Please note... these are all numbered ""1"" 
ON PURPOSE!

1. Learn to work the toilet seat.
You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down.
We need it up; you need it down.
You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.

1. Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.
1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.
1. Crying is blackmail.
1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work!
Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!
1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.
1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do.
Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.
1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.
1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.
In fact, all comments become null and void after7 days.
1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.
1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don 't ask us.
1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways
and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.
1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done.
Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.
1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.
1. Nomadic tribes did not need directions and neither do we.
1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings.
Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. 
Pumpkin is also a fruit.
We have no idea what mauve is.
1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.
1. If we ask what is wrong and you say ""nothing,"" we will act like nothing's wrong.
We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.
1. If you ask a question you dont want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.
1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine...Really.
1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.
1. You have enough clothes.
1. You have too many shoes.
1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.
